# JSON Storage

Project showcases clone of jsonbase, an API with PUT request where user have to provide path in format "/bucket_name/name" and JSON data in body and GET request where user have to provide path in format "/bucket_name/name" to get stored in MongoDB data. Authentication is not available for now. Try to be creative when coming up with bucket names.

#### Setup

```bash
npm install
```
